## Roadmap:
- [x] **[P1] - Symbol Items:**
    - items with a symbol texture and a material-based background color that can be crafted and uncrafted in a stonecutter
    - [x] Crafting & Uncrafting / Transmuting
    - [x] Item Models: base model for each material + overlay for each symbol
    - [x] Item Textures:
        - odd-numbered texture width & height
        - black and white textures for contrast
- [x] **[P2] - Display Panel:**
    - blockentity alternative to item frames
        + has hitbox
        + doesnt need supporting block
        - cant rotate contained items
        - cant place multiple per block
        - cant place on top or bottom block faces
    - [x] Block Model: panel with flat front face and thin borders
    - [x] Block Texture: simple texture with a border to show the edges
    - [x] Dyeable: 16 color variants saved in blockstate & item NBT
    - [x] Hopper Interaction
    - [x] Redstone Locking: prevent any interaction while powered
    - [x] Comparator Output: emits a signal strength relative to item stackability
- [ ] **[P3] Sign Fixture:**
    - blockentity that can attach to top or bottom faces of blocks that are center-supporting
    - can hold a symbol item and display it on a flat surface facing toward and away from the camera when placing, like a road sign
    - can contain any item and display it in the same way
    - [ ] Block Model: very small fixture that grips onto the top or bottom center of the displayed item
    - [ ] Dyeable: 16 color variants saved in blockstate & item NBT

## Symbol Materials:
Materials for crafting the symbol items, each with a distinct background color and a fixed yield of symbol items per craft:  
| Material | BG Color | FG Color | Yield | Prefix |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Iron | Light Gray | Black | 4 | `iron` |
| Redstone | Red | White | 4 | `redstone` |
| Coal | Black | White | 4 | `coal` |
| Gold | Yellow | Black | 4 | `gold` |
| Emerald | Lime Green | Black | 4 | `emerald` |
| Lapis | Blue | Black | 4 | `diamond` |

## Symbols:
Crafted from the symbol templates in a stonecutter, yielding 1 symbol item per craft.  
The symbol items can be uncrafted back into the symbol template in a crafting grid, yielding 1 template per craft.  
The symbol items have a uniform texture design with the symbol in the center and the material's color as a square background, allowing for good contrast and recognizability even at small sizes.  
The model of the symbol item is determined by the NBT component `custom_model_data` (e.g. `0` for the "Letter A" symbol). To figure out the model/texture, refer to the position of each enum value in `common/src/main/java/com/drunkencod/factory_symbols/symbols/SymbolType.java`.  
The symbol items have registry IDs in the format `factory_symbols:symbol_<material>` and the item tags `#factory_symbols:symbols` and `#factory_symbols:symbols/<material>`.
